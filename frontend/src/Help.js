# IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This sends your sms to my system, since ios doesn't allow you to read sms easily.
What this does is send all the sms that comes to your phone to this system.
Then any patterns that are known are used to classify the sms as accepted, or rejected.
The accepted messages would have an amount and a merchant where the money was sent to.

## üìå Notes

- You can only set automations to trigger based on messages containing specific text. Using a common letter like 'e' helps ensure most transactional messages are captured.
- This is a privacy-first tool: the data you send is only tied to your email and accessible via your login at the dashboard.
- For best results, make sure your bank/UPI alerts contain identifiable amounts and senders.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Automation not triggering?** Make sure the test SMS includes the trigger letter ('e') and is received while the device is unlocked.
- **Not seeing messages on the website?** Double-check that the correct **Gmail email address** is used in the 'email' field and that the automation is turned on.
- **Using Dual SIM?** Ensure your transactional messages are received by the number configured on your iPhone.

## üß™ After Setup: Handling Unrecognized Messages

Once your automation is running, some messages may appear in the **Messages** tab at [https://expense.moonblade.work](https://expense.moonblade.work) but are **not marked green (Accepted)**. These are messages that the system couldn‚Äôt automatically classify into a transaction.

Follow these steps to help the system learn:

### üü° Step 1: Open the Message

- Tap on any unaccepted (not green) message.
- This will open the **Pattern Editor** for that specific SMS.

### ‚ú® Step 2: Select Approve or Reject

- For messages that have a payment amount, tap the **Approve** button.
- If the message is not a valid transaction, tap **Reject**.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: For approval

- Tap the amount in the message to select it.
- Tap Payee button.
- Tap the payee in the message to select it.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: For approval and Rejection

- Tap Wildcard
- Tap all parts of the message that will change every message, so that the pattern is generic

### üß™ Step 5: Test the Pattern

- Tap the Tick icon to test the pattern.

### üíæ Step 6: Save the Pattern

- Once the test succeeds, click **Save**.
- The pattern will now be applied automatically to similar messages in the future.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: **Credit transaction patterns are currently not supported**. Only debit messages can be added and tracked.
